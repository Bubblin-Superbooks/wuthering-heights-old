Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine. </p><p> Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!’. </p></div> </div>
