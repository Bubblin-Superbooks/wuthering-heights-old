<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. </p><p> I could not guess the use that either would be of, then. However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the childrenâ€™s room: their door was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer, and did not need me to console them. </p></div> </div>
