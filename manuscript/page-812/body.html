The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,—‘Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after other folk wi’ ther harvest.’. </p><p>‘Gimmerton?’ I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy. ‘Ah! I know. How far is it from this?’</p><p>‘Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,’ he answered.</p></div> </div>
