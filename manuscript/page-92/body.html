The less you meddle with him the better.’</p><p>‘He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl. Do you know anything of his history?’</p><p>‘It’s a cuckoo’s, sir—I know all about it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first. And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock! The unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.’</p><p>‘Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.’</p></div> </div>
