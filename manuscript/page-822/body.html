How could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!’</p><p>‘I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,’ I answered. ‘I depart again to-morrow.

Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?’</p><p>‘From the Grange,’ I replied; ‘and while they make me lodging room there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t think of having another opportunity in a hurry.’</p></div> </div>
