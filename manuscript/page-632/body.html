Mr. Heathcliff, you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from <i>mere</i> malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! <i>do look</i>! you’ll see nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck me. Have you never loved <i>anybody</i> in all your life, uncle? <i>never</i>? Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and pitying me.’</p><p>‘Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!’ cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. ‘I’d rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I <i>detest</i> you!’</p></div> </div>
