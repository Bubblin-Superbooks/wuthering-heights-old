And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. </p><p> We were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused. She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions. </p><p>‘Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.’</p><p>‘No, no, dear, I’m not tired,’ I returned, continually. Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation. </p></div> </div>
