I explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.</p><p>‘And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?’ she pursued.</p><p>‘Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,’ replied I; ‘you could not climb them, they are too high and steep.
