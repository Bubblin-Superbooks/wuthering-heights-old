I believe an interview would convince you that my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also. </p><p> You inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?’. </p><p>Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request; because he could not accompany Catherine.</p></div> </div>
